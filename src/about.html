                <h2>Professional Career...</h2>
                <p>
                    I received my Bachelors in Computer Science from the beautiful University of Victoria
                    in 2021. During my time at UVic, I got the opportunity to do an 8 month work-term with
                    CGI, an IT consulting firm wherein I got work as a QA Analyst. My primary responsibilities
                    were concerned with the writing of automated test cases and the further development of our
                    Selenium-based testing framework.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The majority of my career so far has been spent as a software dev at a VFX and animation
                    company: DNEG. I spent more than two and a half years developing and maintaining various 
                    tools and applications that served an instrumental role in DNEG's production pipeline.
                    Initially I was part of a Python 3 conversion team, but after a few months I stepped into
                    the role of a developer in Core Services. Aside from maintaining core libraries
                    and expanding the usage of GraphQL services/APIs, it was here that I built my first web
                    application. The application in question was a UI that rendered an interative, hierarchical
                    graph that visualized assets and their relation to one another.

                <h2>In my spare time...</h2>
                <p>
                    I love to rock climb at the local gyms and crags in the Calgary area. It's a hobby and 
                    community that I've been engaged with for almost a decade now, and is a consistent
                    fixture in my day-to-day schedule. I also love to play the guitar and bass <span style="font-size: small;">(I'm ok)</span>,
                    and have been discovering the joy of playing music with others by starting a band with some friends <span style="font-size: small;">(we're ok)</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, I spend a great deal of time playing, watching, discussing, and generally thinking
                    about videogames. I particularly love the games produced by Capcom; Devil May Cry, Resident Evil,
                    and Street Fighter are among my favourites. It is a life-long fascination that has entertained and 
                    inspired me. I think it is just such a nuanced medium that allows for artistically and technically 
                    creative minds to come together to produce experiences that can appeal to so many different
                    sensabilities through mechanics, story, music, and art. It is an aspiration of mine to hopefully
                    one day create something that can impact others in the same way that games like Zelda, Hollow Knight, and 
                    Outer Wilds have impacted myself.
